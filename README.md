## About

Monitor NVIDIA GPU memory usage from the terminal, **grouped by user**. SCOPOS
is built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/): the layout adapts to
your terminal size, and every GPU shows an at-a-glance bar of how its memory is
split between users.

- Python: 3.8+

## Installation

### Install with pipx

`pipx` installs the application in an isolated environment while making
the command globally available.

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

```bash
pipx install scopos
```

## Quick Start

### monitor all GPUs

```bash
scopos
```

### highlight user "alice" and show their task details

```bash
scopos -u alice
```

### refresh every 2 seconds

```bash
scopos -i 2
```

### synthetic data, no NVIDIA driver needed

```bash
scopos --demo
```

### start in zen (focus) mode

```bash
scopos -u alice --zen
```

---

## Zen mode

Press <kbd>z</kbd> at any time (or start with `--zen`) to toggle **zen mode**, a
focused layout meant to be paired with `-u/--user`:

- Each GPU's **table** lists only the watched user's processes.
- The per-GPU **bar and legend still show every user** — the watched user is
  highlighted (`★`, bold) so you keep the full picture at a glance.
- The table drops the `USER` and `S.START` columns and instead shows the
  **live fields each process reports** through the Python API below — including
  animated progress bars.
- A resident **`CPU` card** lists every process of the watched user that reports
  to scopos but isn't currently on a GPU — extending the monitor to plain CPU
  jobs (e.g. data preprocessing) and to jobs still importing CUDA / loading
  data. It shows host RAM instead of GPU memory; once a job allocates GPU
  memory it simply appears under its GPU as well.

Every process row shows both `MEM/GB` (GPU memory) and `RAM/GB` (host memory).
The `SESSION` column shows the **tmux session name** (`tmux:<name>`) for
tmux-managed processes — for your own sessions; other users' tmux sockets
aren't readable, so those fall back to `tmux`. Determinate progress bars also
show an **ETA** (`· ~3m 20s`) estimated from how fast the bar is advancing.

## Mouse & shortcuts

- **Hover** any cell to see its full, untruncated content as a tooltip. Built-in
  columns (like `COMMAND`) are width-capped to keep rows compact; user-reported
  metadata columns are always shown in full.
- **Right-click** a process row for a menu: *Copy row info* copies that row's
  fields to the clipboard.
- **Danger mode** (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>) is an
  independent toggle that works in both normal and zen layouts. While it is on,
  the right-click menu also offers **Kill process**, which shows the full row
  details and asks for confirmation before sending a terminate signal. The
  status bar shows a red `⚠ DANGER` reminder while it is armed.

## Python API

`scopos` doubles as a tiny library so your scripts can push live status to the
monitor. Importing it is cheap — no Textual or NVIDIA driver required.

```python
import scopos

# Report plain fields (merged into this process's metadata):
scopos.report(stage="train", loss=0.1234, acc="92.5%")

# Report a progress bar. scopos renders it as a live bar in zen mode:
for step in range(total_steps):
    scopos.report(progress=scopos.progress(step, total_steps))  # e.g. 37/100
    ...

# A fraction in [0, 1] works too, and an indeterminate (animated) bar:
scopos.report(loading=scopos.progress())            # bouncing "…"
scopos.report(warmup=scopos.progress(0.5, label="halfway"))

# Drop a field by reporting None; replace everything with set(...):
scopos.report(loss=None)
scopos.set(stage="done")

# Or scope a run and clean up automatically:
with scopos.session(stage="train"):
    train()   # metadata file removed on exit
```

Each process writes `~/.scopos/metadata/<pid>.json`; `scopos` reads it back and,
in zen mode, shows every reported field as a column next to that process. The
file is removed automatically when your program exits (`atexit`). Set
`$SCOPOS_HOME` to relocate the `.scopos` directory.
